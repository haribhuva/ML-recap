# ML-recap
Revision of ML.

I take dataset from rawatpranjal's repo: 'https://github.com/rawatpranjal/industry-datasets'
Contents of dataset: Sales and forcasting
Dataset name: India Sales
link: 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/girishvutukuri/sales-forecasting-for-small-basket?select=train.csv'

I'm using all of the files which available on link for extracting different insights from the dataset which can make easier my practice over the ML model because, this approach helps me better understand the data and as a result, it becomes easier to design, develop, and improve the machine learning model.
